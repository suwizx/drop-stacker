# Drop Stacker

A Fabric mod for Minecraft that automatically stacks dropped item entities on the ground into a single entity, reducing entity lag and keeping your world tidy.

## Features

- **Instant Merging:** New drops are absorbed into a nearby pile the moment they spawn — in the same tick, not after a scan interval. A mob's drops collapse before you see them land.
- **Whole-Pile Collapse:** Each merge pass drains every compatible neighbour at once, so a 100-item pile becomes one entity in a single pass instead of one item per pass.
- **Limitless Piles:** Stacks beyond vanilla's 64-item limit — up to your configured `maxStackSize`, with per-item overrides.
- **Visual Feedback:** Colorful stack count label displayed above items (configurable thresholds).
- **Despawn Timer:** Optional countdown on the label with urgency-based color coding (supports infinite items with `∞`).
- **Adaptive Scanning:** Idle piles progressively back off from scanning (up to `maxScanInterval`), so a world full of settled items costs almost nothing. Safe because new drops push into piles on spawn rather than waiting to be polled.
- **Item Rules:** Blacklist, whitelist, and per-item stack-size overrides — all accepting item tags (`#minecraft:logs`) as well as exact ids.
- **Runtime Control:** `/dropstacker` reloads config, reports stats, and tunes settings without a restart.
- **Respects Named Items:** An item entity with its own custom name is never relabelled or silently absorbed into another pile.
- **Vanilla Parity:** Merging honours vanilla's infinite-lifetime, near-despawn, and infinite-pickup-delay guards, and keeps the longest pickup delay so merging can't shorten it.
- **Server-Side Only:** All logic runs on the server. Vanilla clients see counts and timers with no mod installed.

## Requirements

- Minecraft 26.3
- [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) 0.19.5+
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
- Java 25+

## Commands

`/dropstacker` requires permission level 2 (gamemasters).

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/dropstacker reload` | Reload the config file from disk |
| `/dropstacker stats` | Merge passes, entities collapsed, and current settings |
| `/dropstacker resetstats` | Reset the counters |
| `/dropstacker toggle` | Enable/disable stacking at runtime |
| `/dropstacker set maxStackSize <n>` | Change the stack cap |
| `/dropstacker set scanInterval <n>` | Change the scan interval |
| `/dropstacker set radius <n>` | Change the horizontal scan radius |
| `/dropstacker set verticalRadius <n>` | Change the vertical scan radius |

## Configuration

The config file is created automatically at `.minecraft/config/drop-stacker.json` (or `config/drop-stacker.json` on a server). Fields update automatically on restart if you upgrade the mod.

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "mergeOnSpawn": true,
  "maxStackSize": 1000,
  "radius": 5.0,
  "verticalRadius": 2.0,
  "scanInterval": 5,
  "maxScanInterval": 100,
  "maxMergePerPass": 64,
  "ageInheritance": "YOUNGEST",
  "labelMode": "ALWAYS",
  "showDespawnTimer": true,
  "countLowThreshold": 64,
  "countHighThreshold": 500,
  "hideSingleItemLabel": false,
  "despawnTicks": 6000,
  "blacklist": [],
  "whitelist": [],
  "overrides": {}
}
```

| Field | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | Master switch for all stacking | `true` |
| `mergeOnSpawn` | Merge new drops instantly as they spawn | `true` |
| `maxStackSize` | Maximum items per stacked entity | `1000` |
| `radius` | Horizontal scan radius (blocks) | `5.0` |
| `verticalRadius` | Vertical scan radius (blocks) | `2.0` |
| `scanInterval` | Ticks between merge scans for an active pile | `5` |
| `maxScanInterval` | Slowest scan rate an idle pile backs off to | `100` |
| `maxMergePerPass` | Max neighbours absorbed in one pass | `64` |
| `ageInheritance` | Despawn timer on merge: `YOUNGEST`, `KEEP_RECEIVER`, or `OLDEST` | `YOUNGEST` |
| `labelMode` | When to show the label: `ALWAYS`, `STACKED_ONLY`, or `NEVER` | `ALWAYS` |
| `showDespawnTimer` | Show despawn countdown on the label | `true` |
| `countLowThreshold` | Count at which the label turns Yellow | `64` |
| `countHighThreshold` | Count at which the label turns Red | `500` |
| `hideSingleItemLabel`| Hide the label if the stack only has 1 item | `false` |
| `despawnTicks` | World despawn rate (matches timer to server settings) | `6000` |
| `blacklist` | Items that are never stacked | `[]` |
| `whitelist` | If non-empty, *only* these items are stacked | `[]` |
| `overrides` | Per-item stack caps | `{}` |

### Item rules

`blacklist`, `whitelist`, and `overrides` all accept exact item ids and item tags (prefixed with `#`):

```json
{
  "blacklist": ["minecraft:elytra", "#minecraft:shulker_boxes"],
  "overrides": {
    "minecraft:cobblestone": 5000,
    "#minecraft:logs": 512
  }
}
```

### A note on `ageInheritance`

The default `YOUNGEST` means a pile inherits the longest remaining lifetime when it absorbs a drop — so a pile next to a farm keeps resetting its despawn timer and effectively never despawns. That is convenient, but on a busy server it lets item piles accumulate indefinitely. Set `KEEP_RECEIVER` for vanilla despawn behaviour.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Output JAR is in `build/libs/`. Gradle provisions the required Java 25 toolchain automatically.
